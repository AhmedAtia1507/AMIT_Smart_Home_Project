# AMIT_Smart_Home_Project
AMIT Smart Home Project
In this project, we implemented a minimized smart home using:
  1) 2 On/Off LEDs and one dimming LED
  2) Door "Simulated as a servo motor"
  3) Air Conditioner "Simulated as a DC motor" and temperature sensor
  
You can control these peripherals as an admin or a user by bluetooth "UART" or by using LCD-Keypad System.

If you logged in as an admin, you can control all features, add user or delete a user.

If you logged in as a user, you are not allowed to control door.
